# CS512-Optimal-Timetable-with-Graph-Coloring

Summary:

To find the optimal solution for NP completeness problems, all possible solutions mustbe considered in order to narrow down to the best one, but this requires an exhaustive search algorithm to accomplish. Thus, to find an optimal solution for NP, it is desired to find the next best answer: “close to optimal” (approximated) solutions.

This, although not the best solution, requires much less time than optimal solutions.

A classic example for NP completeness problems is the timetable optimization which is a schedule of events (like college courses or movies at theaters) to fit in a minimal set of time blocks such that one event cannot simultaneously happen with the other event. So to find an approximation for the close to optimal solution, heuristics are used to accomplish this.
There are many algorithms that can narrow down the close to optimal solution, among them is the graph coloring algorithm.
